# wikidative
WikiDative is a Single Page Application that allows users to register, login and visualize up-to-date data through the use of tools toggles, filters, sliders and interactive charts. This project is inspired by use of Node.js framework as a backend and using Vue.Js as a front end for building analytics tools. The dataset offered in the form of JSON provides the opportunity to work along with a NoSQL database like MongoDB to provide a solid supply of analysis to the end users. The users should be able to see summary analytics of each and every article along with overall analysis of the data and their corresponding revisions.
